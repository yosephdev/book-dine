## User Experience
The primary goal of this project is to provide an exceptional user experience for both customers and restaurant staff. Customers will enjoy a seamless and intuitive process for booking reservations, viewing available tables, and managing their bookings. The system will be designed with a clean and modern interface, ensuring ease of use and accessibility across various devices.

On the other hand, restaurant staff will benefit from a comprehensive administrative interface that streamlines the management of bookings, tables, and customer information. The interface will be user-friendly and efficient, allowing staff to quickly access and update relevant data, ensuring smooth operations and excellent customer service.

## Project Goals
1. **Develop a user-friendly restaurant booking system**: Implement a web-based application that allows customers to easily book reservations, view available tables, and manage their bookings.
2. **Provide an administrative interface**: Create a secure and comprehensive administrative interface for restaurant staff to manage bookings, tables, customer information, and other relevant data.
3. **Ensure data integrity and security**: Implement robust data validation and security measures to protect customer information and ensure the integrity of the booking system.
4. **Enhance customer experience**: Incorporate features that enhance the customer experience, such as email confirmations, reminders, and the ability to leave reviews or feedback.
5. **Optimize for performance and scalability**: Develop the system with performance and scalability in mind, ensuring it can handle high traffic and grow with the restaurant's needs.
6. **Ensure responsiveness and accessibility**: Design the user interface to be responsive and accessible across various devices and platforms, ensuring a consistent and inclusive experience for all users.

## Agile Methodology
The project is developed using Agile methodology to effectively prioritize and organize tasks. This involves creating user stories and utilizing Project Boards on GitHub.

### Prioritization and Classification

To prioritize development efforts, features were classified into the following categories:
- **Must Have**: Essential features required for the core functionality.
- **Should Have**: Important features that enhance the product but are not critical for the initial release.
- **Could Have**: Features that are nice to have but not necessary.
- **Won't Have**: Features that are not included in the current iteration.

This classification facilitated the determination of feature importance and helped in managing development priorities effectively.

### Focus Areas

The product section was given the highest priority, receiving the most attention and resources to ensure its completion and quality.

For more details on the project's progress and planning, visit the [Project Board](https://github.com/users/yosephdev/projects/6/views/1).

## User Stories

Based on the collected user stories, a project implementation plan was developed. You can review the user stories [here](https://github.com/yosephdev/book-dine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).

![User Stories](docs/readme_images/image-3.png)

Each user story was assigned a point value reflecting its implementation complexity. The MoSCoW principle (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have) was used to plan iterations and prioritize tasks.

Milestones for the project can be reviewed [here](https://github.com/CodeWizard-1/e-commerce/milestones?state=closed).

## Automated Testing

Automatic testing results are below.


### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test`

![screenshot](docs/readme_images/image-test1.png)


`python-m coverage report`

![Alt text](docs/readme_images/image-test2.png)

### Error Pages
1. **400 Bad Request**:
   - Trigger a 400 error (e.g., by sending a malformed request).
   - Verify that the custom 400 error page is displayed.

2. **500 Internal Server Error**:
   - Trigger a 500 error (e.g., by causing an exception in the code).
   - Verify that the custom 500 error page is displayed.
