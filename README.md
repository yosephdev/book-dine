## Agile Methodology
The project is being developed using an Agile methodology to help prioritize and organize tasks. This involves writing user stories and using Project Boards on GitHub.

## User Stories and Epics

A template is created to help write user stories in a consistent format: "As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]." Epics are also written, containing possible user stories. Based on these epics, the website features are planned and implemented.

User stories are created by looking at the epics and refined through an iterative process as the project progresses. This allows me to stay focused on delivering value to users.

### User Stories

#### User Registration and Login
- As a new user, I want to register so that I can make a reservation.
- As a registered user, I want to log in so that I can access my account.

#### Homepage
- As a user, I want to see a homepage that displays the restaurant’s information and allows me to navigate to different parts of the site.

#### Making a Reservation
- As a user, I want to select a date, time, and number of guests for my reservation so that I can book a table.
- As a user, I want to receive a confirmation after I make a reservation so that I know it was successful.

#### Viewing and Updating a Reservation
- As a user, I want to view my reservations so that I can keep track of them.
- As a user, I want to update my reservation (change the date, time, or number of guests) so that I can make changes if my plans change.

#### Canceling a Reservation
- As a user, I want to cancel my reservation so that the table can be freed up if I can’t make it.

#### Reviewing a Restaurant
- As a user, I want to write a review about my experience at the restaurant so that other users can read it.

### Project Board
The project board on GitHub is set to public, allowing for transparency and collaboration. It is used to track the progression of tasks through the "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done" columns.

Labels are added to the issues to sort them based on importance, such as "high priority", "medium priority", and "low priority". This helps me prioritize the most critical tasks.

## Target Audience
The restaurant booking system will cater to three main user groups:
- **First time user**: First-time users will be able to easily navigate the system to find available tables, view restaurant information, and make reservations. The system will provide clear instructions and intuitive interfaces to guide them through the booking process.
- **Registered user**: Registered users will have additional features, such as the ability to view their booking history, update their profile information, and receive notifications about upcoming reservations. They will also be able to leave reviews and ratings for the restaurant.
- **Admin user**: Admin users, typically restaurant staff, will have access to a comprehensive management interface. They will be able to view and manage all bookings, add or remove tables, update restaurant information, and generate reports. The admin interface will be designed to be user-friendly and efficient, allowing staff to quickly access and update information as needed.

## Design

## Data Model

### User Journey
The user journey will be carefully mapped out to ensure a seamless and intuitive experience for all users. This will include the steps involved in making a reservation, updating a booking, and accessing the admin dashboard.

### Database Scheme
The database scheme will be designed using PostgreSQL, a powerful and reliable open-source database management system. The scheme will include tables for users, bookings, tables, and restaurant details, with appropriate relationships and constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency.

#### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
![Database Relational Diagram](docs/readme_images/bookdine.png)

### Models
I've introduced new models to represent key entities in the system:

- **Restaurant**: Represents a restaurant with attributes such as name, location, cuisine, etc.
- **Table**: Represents a table in a restaurant with attributes like capacity and table number.
- **Reservation**: Represents a reservation made by a user for a specific table on a given date and time.
- **Review**: Represents a review left by a user for a restaurant, including a rating and comments.

These models are designed to capture essential data and facilitate smooth interaction within the application.

## Security Features
The restaurant booking system will incorporate robust security features to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. This will include:
- Password hashing and salting to securely store user passwords
- CSRF protection to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks
- SSL/TLS encryption to secure communication between the client and server
- Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attacks

- **Unit tests**: Unit tests have been written for individual components and functions to verify their correctness and behavior. The `tests.py` file contains unit tests for the following models:
  - `Restaurant` model: Tests the `__str__` method to ensure it returns the expected string representation of the restaurant.
  - `Table` model: Tests the `__str__` method and the `is_available` method to verify the table's string representation and availability check.
  - `Reservation` model: Tests the `__str__` method to ensure it returns the expected string representation of the reservation.
  - `Review` model: Tests the `__str__` method to verify the string representation of the review.

- **Integration tests**: Integration tests have been implemented to verify the interaction between different modules. The `tests.py` file includes integration tests for the following views:
  - `home_view`: Tests the home view to ensure it renders the correct template and retrieves the featured restaurants and latest reservations.
  - `restaurant_detail_view`: Tests the restaurant detail view to verify it renders the correct template and retrieves the restaurant details.
  - `make_reservation_view`: Tests the make reservation view to ensure it handles reservation creation correctly and redirects to the reservation success page.
  - `view_reservations_view`: Tests the view reservations view to verify it renders the correct template and retrieves the user's reservations.
  - `write_review_view`: Tests the write review view to ensure it handles review submission correctly and redirects to the restaurant detail page.
